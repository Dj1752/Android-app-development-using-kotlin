A Roadmap to Learn
Start with the Overview of Android. Read some android related blogs and also research some Android-related things. For example read blogs on Introduction to Android Development, History of Android, Different Versions of Android, and also topics like Why Kotlin will replace Java for Android App Development, etc. etc. and make a complete mind makeup to start your journey on Android. Make yourself self-motivated to learn Android and build some awesome projects on Android. Do it regularly and also start learning one by one new concept on Android. It will be very better to join some workshops or conferences on Android before you start your journey. Make your goal clear and move on toward your goal.

1) Programming

One may consider this step as a prerequisite. Learn these programming languages before you start learning Android.

Java Programming Language
Kotlin Programming Language
Sound Knowledge of XML (Extensible Markup Language)
2) Android Studio

It’s better to know your tools before you are going to use it. Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment for Google’s Android operating system, built on JetBrains’ IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development.

File Structure:
AndroidManifest.xml file
Java file
Drawable file
Layout file
mipmap file
colors.xml file
strings.xml file
styles.xml file
build.gradle(Module: app) file
Android Studio Overview:
Create a new project
Reopen, close, save the project
Create a new activity, classes, drawable resource files
Run the app on AVD of Emulator or in a real device etc.
3) Android Components

There are some necessary building blocks that an Android application consists of. These loosely coupled components are bound by the application manifest file which contains a description of each component and how they interact. 

Activity:
Activity life cycle
Handle Activity State Changes
Understand Tasks and Back Stack
Processes and Application Lifecycle
Services:
Types of Android Services
The Life Cycle of Android Services
Content Provider:
Content URI
Operations in Content Provider
Working of the Content Provider
Creating a Content Provider
Broadcast Receiver:
Implicit Broadcast Exceptions
4) Simple UI Design

After you got an idea about the different components of Android then start exploring some simple UI design which is given below.

Explore different layouts:
Frame
Linear
Relative
Constraint
View Elements:
TextView
EditText
Buttons
ImageView
Intent:
Implicit
Explicit
Intent Filter
5) Complex UI Design

Once you have a command on simple UI design then solely move to the complex UI design part such as:

ListView
RecycleVIew
Fragments
Dialogs
Toast
Bottom Sheets
Navigation Drawer
Tabs
Material Design
Some inserting Animations
6) Storage

In Android, there are three types of the storage system:

Shared Preferences
File System
Database
RoomDB
7) Build

Gradle
Debug/ Release Configuration
8) Threading

Threads
Looper
9) Debugging

One of the most important skills of a developer is debugging skills. So the developer must learn these things:

Exceptions
Error Handling
Logging
Memory Profiling
10) Memory Leaks

Cause of memory leaks
Detecting and fixing memory leaks
Context
11) Third-Party Libraries

Image Loading Libraries
Glide
Picasso
Fresco
COIL
Dependency Injection
Dragger
Networking
Retrofit
Multithreading
Coroutines
Rxjava
12) Android Jetpack


On its official site, it says Android Jetpack is a set of libraries, tools, and architectural guidance to help make it quick and easy to build great Android apps. It provides common infrastructure code so you can focus on what makes your app unique.


AppCompat library
Architecture components,
Animation and transitions
Android Ktx
Navigation
Paging
Slices
WorkManager
13) Android Architecture

The three famous architecture in the Android world are:

MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)
MVI (Model-View-Intent)
MVP (Model View Presenter)
14) Firebase

FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
Analytics
Remote Config
App Indexing
15) Unit Testing

Local Unit Testing
Instrumentation Testing
16) Security

Encrypt / Decrypt
Proguard
17) App Release

Signed APK
Play Store
